# Skill Template - Copy and customize this template

## Basic Information
- **Skill Name**: [unique_skill_name_with_muse]
- **Health Domain**: [sleep|stress|nutrition|movement|meds_adherence]  
- **Muse Archetype**: [coach|caretaker|scientist|playmate]

## Activation Triggers
- **When to Use**: 
  - [Describe specific situations, contexts, or user states that should trigger this skill]
  - [Include time conditions, emotional states, or behavioral cues]

## Behavior Model
Choose COM-B or Fogg mapping:

### COM-B Model:
- **Capability**: [What the user needs to be able to do - skills, knowledge, physical ability]
- **Opportunity**: [Physical and social environment that enables the behavior]
- **Motivation**: [Reflective motivation (plans, beliefs) and automatic motivation (emotions, impulses)]

### Fogg B=MAP Model:
- **Behavior**: [The specific target behavior]
- **Motivation**: [Why the user would want to do this - benefits, values alignment]
- **Ability**: [How easy/hard this is - time, physical effort, mental effort, social deviance, non-routine]
- **Prompt**: [What triggers the behavior - person, context, technology]

## Micro-Intervention (The core of the skill)
- **2-Minute Starter**: [Ultra-simple version that takes â‰¤2 minutes and builds confidence]
- **Habit Stack**: "After [existing habit], I will [new behavior]"
- **Friction Reducer**: [Remove one obstacle that prevents the behavior]

## Script Kit (Muse Communication)
Customize these for your chosen muse archetype:

- **Empathic**: [Warm, understanding, validating message that acknowledges struggle]
- **Practical**: [Clear, action-focused message with concrete next steps]  
- **Playful**: [Fun, creative, engaging message that makes it feel like play/adventure]

## Safety Guardrails
- **Medical Boundaries**: [What medical advice this skill should NOT give]
- **Escalation Rules**: [When to refer to healthcare professionals]
- **Autonomy Preservation**: [How to ensure user choice and control]

## Observation & Measurement
- **Observation Signals**: 
  - Mood indicators: [What emotional/mood changes to watch for]
  - Adherence metrics: [What behaviors to track]
  - Resistance vectors: [Common reasons for non-compliance]
  - Recovery patterns: [How users typically restart after lapses]

## Success Metrics
- **Short-term** (daily/weekly):
  - [Quantified measures like streak days, completion rate, frequency]
- **Mid-term** (monthly):  
  - [Self-reported improvements, symptom changes, quality of life measures]

## Reflection Prompts
- "[What helped you succeed with this today?]"
- "[What got in the way or made it harder?]"
- "[What would make this easier next time?]"
- "[What did you notice about how this made you feel?]"

## Example Implementation Notes
- Keep interventions under 2 minutes for the starter
- Stack onto existing habits when possible
- Use the muse's characteristic voice and motivation style
- Always preserve user autonomy with choice-offering language
- Build in safety guardrails specific to the health domain
- Make success measurable and trackable
