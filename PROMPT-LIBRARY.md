## üîê Section 5: Safety and Ethical Prompts

### Template 5A: HIPAA Compliance Check
```
Before using any AI tool, verify:
- [ ] All patient identifiers removed (name, DOB, MRN, SSN, address)
- [ ] Geographic identifiers generalized (state/region only)
- [ ] Dates shifted or generalized (age instead of DOB)
- [ ] Specific institutional details removed
- [ ] Provider names anonymized
```

### Template 5B: Clinical Decision Validation
```
"After receiving AI recommendations, always ask:

1. Are these suggestions consistent with current evidence-based guidelines?
2. Do the recommendations account for this specific patient's comorbidities and contraindications?
3. What are the potential risks and benefits of following these suggestions?
4. Should I seek additional clinical input before implementing these recommendations?
5. How will I monitor for effectiveness and adverse effects?"
```

### Template 5C: Patient Communication Framework
```
When discussing AI-assisted care with patients:

"We use artificial intelligence tools to help analyze medical information and suggest treatment options. These tools help us:
- Review large amounts of medical research quickly
- Identify patterns we might miss
- Ensure we're following current best practices

However, all final medical decisions are made by your healthcare team, taking into account your specific situation, preferences, and values. The AI is a tool that supports, but never replaces, human clinical judgment."
```
