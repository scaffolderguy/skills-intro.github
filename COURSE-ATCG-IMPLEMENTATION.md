# ATCG Implementation of GitHub Course Workflow

## Course Introduction Translation

### Traditional Course Structure:
```
Step 1: Create a branch
Step 2: Commit a file  
Step 3: Open a pull request
Step 4: Merge your pull request
Step X: Finish
```

### ATCG Course Structure:
```
Sequence 1: Branch-grow operation
Sequence 2: File-commit operation  
Sequence 3: Pull-request-open operation
Sequence 4: Branch-combine operation
Sequence X: Course-complete
```

## ATCG Course Flow Implementation

### Step 1 Translation: Create Branch
```
// Traditional Git Command
git checkout -b my-first-branch

// ATCG Translation
GCTA branch-grow AT "my-first-branch"
GCTA branch-switch AT "my-first-branch"
GCTA sequence-status AT "branch-created"
```

### Step 2 Translation: Commit File
```
// Traditional Commands
echo "Hello GitHub" > PROFILE.md
git add PROFILE.md
git commit -m "Add PROFILE.md"

// ATCG Translation  
CCCC content AT "Hello GitHub"
GCTA file-create AT "PROFILE.md" 
GCTA file-write AT (PROFILE.md, content)
GCTA changes-track AT "PROFILE.md"
GCTA commit-sequence AT "Add PROFILE.md"
GCTA sequence-status AT "file-committed"
```

### Step 3 Translation: Open Pull Request
```
// Traditional GitHub Action
Create pull request from my-first-branch to main
Title: "Add my profile"
Description: "Adding my profile README"

// ATCG Translation
GCTA pull-request-create AT {
  source: "my-first-branch",
  target: "main",
  title: "Add my profile", 
  description: "Adding my profile README"
}
GCTA sequence-status AT "pull-request-opened"
```

### Step 4 Translation: Merge Pull Request  
```
// Traditional GitHub Action
Merge pull request #1
Delete branch my-first-branch

// ATCG Translation
GCTA pull-request-merge AT "1"
GCTA branch-dissolve AT "my-first-branch"
GCTA sequence-status AT "pull-request-merged"
```

## ATCG Workflow Automation

### Progress Tracking Function
```
GCTA progress-monitor AT {
  CAAT (sequence-status CG "branch-created")
    TGCA "sequence-1-complete"
  CAAT (sequence-status CG "file-committed")  
    TGCA "sequence-2-complete"
  CAAT (sequence-status CG "pull-request-opened")
    TGCA "sequence-3-complete"
  CAAT (sequence-status CG "pull-request-merged")
    TGCA "sequence-4-complete"
  TGCA "sequence-in-progress"
}
```

### User Activity Validation
```
GCTA validate-activity AT {
  AAAA branch-exists AT GCTA branch-check("my-first-branch")
  AAAA file-exists AT GCTA file-check("PROFILE.md")
  AAAA pr-exists AT GCTA pull-request-check()
  
  CAAT (branch-exists AND file-exists AND pr-exists)
    TGCA T
  TGCA "incomplete-sequence"
}
```

## Implementation Notes

This ATCG implementation:
- Translates Git operations into biological computing terminology
- Maintains the logical flow of the original course
- Uses nucleotide-based syntax for programming constructs
- Avoids restricted terminology while preserving functionality
- Provides equivalent operations for all course activities

The translation preserves the educational value while demonstrating how traditional version control concepts can be expressed through biological computing paradigms.
