### AI Analysis Prompt
```
"Here's the medical history of a 68-year-old male patient:
- Chief complaint: Recurring fatigue over 6 months
- Medications: Metformin 1000mg BID, Lisinopril 10mg daily, Atorvastatin 20mg daily
- Recent labs: HbA1c 8.2%, eGFR 45 ml/min/1.73m¬≤, BUN 28, Creatinine 1.6
- Symptoms: Fatigue, occasional shortness of breath, mild ankle swelling
- Blood pressure: 145/88 mmHg average

Can you identify any overlooked patterns or correlations between symptoms, medications, and test results?"
```

### Expected AI Insights
- **Diabetic nephropathy progression** affecting kidney function
- **Cardiovascular risk factors** clustering (diabetes, hypertension, declining renal function)
- **Medication dosing concerns** with declining kidney function
- **Heart failure risk** given symptoms and comorbidities

### Clinical Action Items
- Evaluate need for ACE inhibitor adjustment based on kidney function
- Consider cardiology referral for heart failure evaluation
- Review diabetic medication options suitable for CKD stage 3a
- Implement enhanced monitoring protocol

## üìö Case Study 2: Guideline-Based Treatment Optimization

### Patient Profile (Anonymized)
- **Demographics**: 55-year-old African American female
- **Condition**: Type 2 Diabetes, newly diagnosed hypertension
- **Current Treatment**: Metformin 1000mg BID, Amlodipine 5mg daily
- **Recent Labs**: HbA1c 8.5%, eGFR 78 ml/min/1.73m¬≤, LDL 145 mg/dL
- **Blood Pressure**: 158/94 mmHg (multiple readings)
- **Family History**: Stroke (mother), diabetes (father)
- **BMI**: 32 kg/m¬≤

### Guideline Cross-Check Prompt
```
"Based on this treatment plan for a 55-year-old African American female with:
- Type 2 Diabetes: HbA1c 8.5%, currently on Metformin 1000mg BID
- Hypertension: BP 158/94, currently on Amlodipine 5mg daily
- eGFR 78 ml/min/1.73m¬≤, LDL 145 mg/dL
- Family history of stroke and diabetes
- BMI 32

Are there any updates or recommendations from current ADA 2024 and ACC/AHA 2017 guidelines that should be considered?"
```

### Expected Guideline Updates
- **ACE inhibitor or ARB** preferred over calcium channel blocker for diabetic hypertension
- **SGLT2 inhibitor** consideration for cardiovascular and renal protection
- **Statin therapy** indicated for diabetic patients with cardiovascular risk factors
- **Blood pressure target** <130/80 for diabetic patients

## ‚öôÔ∏è Case Study 3: Diagnostic Recalibration

### Patient Profile (Anonymized)
- **Demographics**: 42-year-old female
- **Current Diagnosis**: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (6 months)
- **Symptoms**: Persistent fatigue, muscle weakness, cold intolerance, hair thinning
- **Recent Labs**: TSH 0.1 mIU/L, Free T4 2.8 ng/dL, Free T3 4.2 pg/mL
- **Additional Labs**: Anti-TPO antibodies 150 IU/mL (normal <35)
- **Physical Exam**: Slight tremor, warm skin, tachycardia (HR 98)
- **History**: 10-pound weight loss over 3 months, difficulty sleeping

### Diagnostic Challenge Prompt
```
"Given this patient's symptoms, lab results, and history:
- Current diagnosis: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (diagnosed 6 months ago)
- Symptoms: Persistent fatigue, muscle weakness, cold intolerance, hair thinning
- Labs: TSH 0.1 mIU/L, Free T4 2.8 ng/dL, Anti-TPO antibodies 150 IU/mL
- Physical findings: Slight tremor, warm skin, tachycardia
- History: 10-pound weight loss, sleep difficulties

Is the current diagnosis still the most accurate? Are there alternative diagnoses or treatments worth considering?"
```

### Expected Diagnostic Refinement
- **Primary consideration**: Hyperthyroidism (Graves' disease or Hashimoto's thyrotoxicosis)
- **Supporting evidence**: Suppressed TSH, elevated T4, positive TPO antibodies
- **Symptom correlation**: Weight loss, tachycardia, tremor more consistent with hyperthyroidism
- **Next steps**: Endocrinology referral, thyroid ultrasound, TRAb antibodies

## üß™ Case Study 4: Follow-Up Protocol Development

### Patient Profile (Anonymized)
- **Demographics**: 58-year-old male
- **Condition**: Newly diagnosed hypertension
- **Current Treatment**: Lisinopril 10mg daily (started 2 weeks ago)
- **Baseline Labs**: Normal basic metabolic panel, eGFR 82
- **Risk Factors**: Family history of MI, former smoker (quit 5 years ago)
- **BMI**: 28 kg/m¬≤
- **Blood Pressure**: 152/96 ‚Üí 142/88 (current, on treatment)

### Follow-Up Planning Prompt
```
"What follow-up tests or monitoring should be considered for a 58-year-old male with:
- Newly diagnosed hypertension (BP was 152/96, now 142/88 on Lisinopril 10mg daily)
- Started antihypertensive treatment 2 weeks ago
- Family history of myocardial infarction
- Former smoker (quit 5 years ago), BMI 28

- **Cardiovascular risk assessment**: Consider ECG, lipid panel
- **Lifestyle interventions**: Dietary counseling, exercise program
- **Long-term monitoring**: Every 3-6 months once stable
