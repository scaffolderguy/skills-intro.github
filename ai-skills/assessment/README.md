## 📈 Assessment Scoring

**Calculation Method:**
1. Count total checkmarks for each level across all domains
2. Calculate weighted score: (Level 1 × 1) + (Level 2 × 2) + (Level 3 × 3) + (Level 4 × 4) + (Level 5 × 5)
3. Divide by maximum possible score (total questions × 5)

**Overall Maturity Score:**
- 0.0-0.4: **Initial** - Significant transformation needed
- 0.4-0.6: **Managed** - Moderate transformation required  
- 0.6-0.8: **Defined** - Advanced capabilities needed
- 0.8-0.9: **Quantitatively Managed** - Optimization opportunities
- 0.9-1.0: **Optimizing** - Continuous improvement focus
