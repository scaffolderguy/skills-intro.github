# User profiles directory

This directory contains generated user profiles for execution stations. 

Each user profile includes:
- Cognitive style configuration
- Resource requirements
- Tool preferences
- Kubernetes manifests

Example usage:
```bash
make generate-profile USER_ID=alice COGNITIVE_STYLE=visual_systemic
```

This will create:
- `alice-profile.yaml` - Complete user profile
- `alice/` - Directory with Kubernetes manifests
