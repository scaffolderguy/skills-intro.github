## 🚀 Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
import asyncio
from highballer_ai_team import HighballerTeam
from highballer_ai_team.agents import (
    IncidentCommanderAI, CodeRefactorSpecialist, 
    SecuritySentinel, InfraArchitectAI, HumanAIInterfaceStrategist
)
from highballer_ai_team.core.base_agent import Priority

async def deploy_highballer_team():
    # Create the team coordinator
    team = HighballerTeam()
    
    # Register elite AI agents
    team.register_agent(IncidentCommanderAI())
    team.register_agent(CodeRefactorSpecialist())
    team.register_agent(SecuritySentinel())
    team.register_agent(InfraArchitectAI())
    team.register_agent(HumanAIInterfaceStrategist())
    
    # Initialize the team
    await team.initialize_team()
    
    # Handle a critical incident
    incident_id = team.create_task(
        task_type="incident",
        priority=Priority.CRITICAL,
        data={
            "description": "Database connection pool exhausted",
            "affected_systems": ["database", "api", "user_portal"],
            "impact_scope": "all_users"
        }
    )
    
    # Execute the response
    result = await team.execute_next_task()
    return result

# Deploy your elite team
asyncio.run(deploy_highballer_team())
```

### Emergency Escalation

```python
# For critical situations requiring immediate response
emergency_id = team.emergency_escalation({
    "incident_type": "security_breach",
    "description": "Potential data exfiltration detected", 
    "affected_systems": ["user_database", "payment_system"],
    "immediate_action_required": True
})
```
