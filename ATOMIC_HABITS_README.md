# Atomic Habits NOVA Integration 🧠⚡

Transform your knowledge work into compound habits using James Clear's Atomic Habits principles integrated with adaptive intelligence.

## Overview

This repository implements a practical system that maps Atomic Habits concepts to a NOVA (Notice-Observe-Verify-Adapt) adaptive learning loop, creating compound effects in both habit formation and knowledge work productivity.

## 🎯 Core Principle

**Small consistent actions compound into extraordinary results.** This system helps you:

- Build sustainable habits through 2-minute starters
- Create automatic behavior chains through habit stacking  
- Reduce friction and resistance over time
- Get immediate feedback and micro-rewards
- Adapt to your environment and context

## 🚀 Five Quick Experiments

### 1. Rule-of-Three Ritual
Start each day by identifying 3 outcomes and breaking them into 2-minute starters.

```python
from atomic_habits_integration import AtomicHabitsNOVA

habits = AtomicHabitsNOVA()
daily_three = habits.daily_three_ritual()

# Example outcomes:
# 1. Finish project proposal → Open document and write executive summary header
# 2. Respond to client emails → Open email and reply to Sarah's question  
# 3. Review team feedback → Open feedback document and read first comment
```

### 2. Habit Stacking
After completing a task, get suggestions for logical follow-up actions.

```python
# After completing "Wrote project summary"
stack = habits.habit_stack_suggestion("Wrote project summary", {
    "project": "Website Redesign",
    "energy_level": "high"
})

# Suggests: "Find the next smallest step for Website Redesign"
# Creates chain: "When I finish writing summary, I will find next step for 2 minutes"
```

### 3. Two-Minute Starters
Break any intimidating task into an easy 2-minute beginning.

```python
starter = habits.two_minute_starter("Write comprehensive project proposal")
# Returns: "Open document and write one sentence"
# Principle: "Start with something so easy you can't say no"
```

### 4. Immediate Rewards
Get instant feedback and reduce resistance through micro-wins.

```python
reward = habits.resistance_bandit_reward(
    "Completed daily planning", 
    resistance_level=0.8,
    outcome="Created clear priorities"
)
# Resistance: 0.8 → 0.6 (20% reduction)
# Builds momentum for similar future actions
```

### 5. Environment Cues
Get context-aware suggestions based on your current situation.

```python
context = {
    "project": "Mobile App Launch",
    "time_of_day": "morning", 
    "energy_level": "high"
}

cue = habits.environment_cue_detection(context)
# Returns: "🎯 In Mobile App Launch: What's the smallest next step?"
```

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

### Basic Python Usage

1. **Download the files:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/scaffolderguy/skills-intro.github.git
   cd skills-intro.github
   ```

2. **Run examples:**
   ```bash
   python examples.py  # See all five experiments in action
   python atomic_habits_integration.py  # Test core functionality
   ```

3. **Use the CLI:**
   ```bash
   python cli.py daily-three              # Start your daily ritual
   python cli.py starter "write proposal" # Get 2-minute starter
   python cli.py complete "sent emails"   # Mark task complete
   python cli.py stats                    # View your progress
   python cli.py search "productivity"    # Enhanced search
   ```

### Integration with Existing Systems

```python
from atomic_habits_integration import integrate_atomic_habits

# Enhance any knowledge base with atomic habits
enhanced_kb = integrate_atomic_habits(your_existing_kb)

# Now searches include habit suggestions
result = enhanced_kb.knowledge_base_search("how to start project", 
    user_context={"energy_level": "low", "time_of_day": "afternoon"})

# Returns enhanced results with:
# - 2-minute starters
# - Habit stacking suggestions  
# - Environment-specific cues
# - User progress stats
```

## 📊 Progress Tracking

The system automatically tracks:

- **Daily Three Streak**: Consecutive days completing the ritual
- **Micro-Wins**: Total successful 2-minute starters  
- **Resistance Reduction**: Average decrease in task resistance
- **Habit Stacks**: Successful behavior chains created
- **Momentum Score**: Compound effect of recent activity

View your progress anytime:

```bash
python cli.py stats
```

```
📊 Your Atomic Habits Progress
========================================
🔥 Daily Three Streak: 7 days
🏆 Total Micro-Wins: 23
📉 Avg Resistance Reduction: 0.18
🔗 Habit Stacks Created: 12
⚡ Momentum Score: 0.76/1.0

🎯 Next Milestone: 14 days
   Only 7 days until your 14-day milestone!
   Reward: Two weeks of consistency! 🔥
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Customize behavior through `config.json`:

```json
{
  "atomic_habits_config": {
    "two_minute_rule": {
      "default_time_limit": 120,
      "starter_templates": {
        "write": "Open document and write one sentence",
        "research": "Find and bookmark one relevant article"
      }
    },
    "resistance_bandit": {
      "initial_resistance": 0.5,
      "resistance_reduction_per_win": 0.2
    }
  }
}
```

## 🧪 Scientific Foundation

Based on research from:

- **James Clear's Atomic Habits**: 1% daily improvement compounds dramatically
- **Habit Loop Psychology**: Cue → Craving → Response → Reward
- **Four Laws of Behavior Change**: Make it Obvious, Attractive, Easy, Satisfying
- **Multi-Armed Bandit Theory**: Adaptive learning from micro-feedback

## 🔄 The Compound Effect

This system creates three compound loops:

1. **Personal Habits**: Each 2-minute starter makes the next one easier
2. **System Intelligence**: Successful patterns become permanent system knowledge  
3. **Adaptive Feedback**: User success improves future suggestions

**Result**: Exponential improvement in both habit formation and knowledge work effectiveness.

## 📈 Real-World Impact

After implementing this system:

- **Reduced procrastination** through 2-minute starters
- **Increased consistency** via daily three ritual
- **Better follow-through** using habit stacking
- **Lower resistance** to challenging tasks over time
- **Automatic behaviors** for routine knowledge work
