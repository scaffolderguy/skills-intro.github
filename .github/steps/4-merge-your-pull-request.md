## Step 4: Follow-Up Tests & Monitoring ðŸ§ª

_You opened a diagnostic recalibration pull request! :tada:_

Now you'll learn how to use AI to develop systematic follow-up protocols and monitoring strategies for your patients.

**What is AI-assisted follow-up planning?** It's using artificial intelligence to recommend appropriate diagnostic tests, monitoring schedules, and care protocols based on patient risk factors and current evidence.

**Key Components:**
- **Risk Stratification**: Categorize patients by risk level for targeted monitoring
- **Evidence-Based Protocols**: Follow current guidelines for screening and follow-up
- **Personalized Timelines**: Adjust monitoring based on individual patient factors
- **Quality Metrics**: Track outcomes and adherence to protocols

### :keyboard: Activity: Merge training materials and complete setup

1. Navigate to your pull request by clicking the **Pull requests** tab and selecting your `AI Clinical Insight Training Materials` pull request.

2. Review the training materials you've created.

3. Click **Merge pull request**.

4. Click **Confirm merge**.

5. Once merged, click **Delete branch** to clean up your workspace.

6. Navigate back to the **Code** tab to see your completed training repository.

### Follow-Up Protocol Template

Add this to your clinical workflow:

```markdown
# AI-Assisted Follow-Up Protocol

## Patient Assessment
- **Condition**: [Primary diagnosis]
- **Risk Factors**: [List relevant risk factors]
- **Current Status**: [Stable, improving, concerning]
- **Compliance**: [Medication adherence, lifestyle factors]

## AI Prompt for Follow-Up Planning
```
"What follow-up tests or monitoring should be considered for a patient with:
- [PRIMARY CONDITION]
- Age [AGE], [DEMOGRAPHICS]
- Risk factors: [LIST RISK FACTORS]
- Current treatment: [MEDICATIONS/INTERVENTIONS]
- Recent results: [KEY LAB VALUES/VITALS]

Based on current [RELEVANT GUIDELINE] guidelines?"
```

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Risk level assessed
- [ ] Appropriate testing interval determined
- [ ] Patient education provided
- [ ] Follow-up appointments scheduled
- [ ] Monitoring protocol documented
- [ ] Team notification completed
```

Congratulations! You've successfully completed the AI-Assisted Clinical Insight training setup.
