## Step 3: Recalibrate Diagnosis & Treatment ⚙️

_You created guideline validation templates! :tada:_

This step focuses on using AI to refine existing diagnoses and treatment plans based on comprehensive patient data analysis.

**What is diagnostic recalibration?** It's the process of using AI to systematically review and potentially challenge existing diagnoses by analyzing all available patient data holistically.

**Key Applications:**
- **Differential Diagnosis Generation**: AI suggests alternative diagnoses based on symptoms and lab results
- **Diagnostic Confidence Assessment**: Evaluate strength of current diagnostic decisions
- **Treatment Optimization**: Refine therapy based on comprehensive data analysis
- **Clinical Decision Support**: Provide evidence-based diagnostic reasoning

**Important Safety Note:** AI provides diagnostic support, not final diagnoses. All AI suggestions require clinical validation and human oversight.

### :keyboard: Activity: Create a diagnostic recalibration workflow

1. Navigate to the **Pull requests** tab in your repository.

2. Click **New pull request**.

3. In the **base:** dropdown, make sure **main** is selected.

4. In the **compare:** dropdown, select `medical-history-analysis`.

5. Add a title for your pull request: `AI Clinical Insight Training Materials`.

6. In the description box, add:
   ```markdown
   ## Diagnostic Recalibration Workflow

   ### Case Study Template
   - **Current Diagnosis**: [Existing diagnosis]
   - **Patient Presentation**: [Key symptoms and timeline]
   - **Laboratory Results**: [Relevant lab values and trends]
   - **Medical History**: [Pertinent past medical history]
   - **Current Treatment Response**: [How patient is responding]

   ### AI Analysis Prompt
   ```
   "Given this patient's symptoms, lab results, and history:
   - Current diagnosis: [CURRENT DIAGNOSIS]
   - Symptoms: [LIST KEY SYMPTOMS]
   - Labs: [KEY LABORATORY VALUES]
   - History: [RELEVANT MEDICAL HISTORY]
   - Treatment response: [CURRENT RESPONSE TO TREATMENT]

   Is the current diagnosis still the most accurate? Are there alternative 
   diagnoses or treatments worth considering?"
   ```

   ### Review Protocol
   1. **AI Analysis**: Generate differential diagnoses and treatment options
   2. **Clinical Review**: Healthcare team evaluates AI suggestions
   3. **Evidence Check**: Validate recommendations against current literature
   4. **Patient Discussion**: Consider patient preferences and contraindications
   5. **Implementation**: Modify care plan if appropriate
   ```

7. Click **Create pull request**.

8. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page. The training will advance to Step 4.
