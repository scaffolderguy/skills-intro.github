## Step 1: Medical History Pattern Analysis üîç

_Master the art of structuring patient data for AI analysis._

You created a repository! :tada:

In this step, you'll learn how to prepare patient data for AI analysis while maintaining privacy and accuracy. This is the foundation of effective AI-assisted clinical insight.

**What is medical history pattern analysis?** It's the process of organizing and presenting patient information to AI systems in a way that maximizes pattern recognition while ensuring patient privacy through anonymization.

**Key Principles:**
- **Anonymization First**: Never use real patient identifiers
- **Structured Data**: Organize information consistently
- **Relevant Context**: Include pertinent medical history, medications, and symptoms
- **Clear Objectives**: Define what patterns you're seeking

**Example Patient Template:**
```
Patient Profile: [Generic Identifier]
- Demographics: Age, gender (no names/addresses)
- Chief Complaint: Primary reason for visit
- Current Medications: Name, dose, frequency
- Recent Labs/Vitals: Relevant values only
- Medical History: Pertinent past conditions
- Current Symptoms: Duration, severity, characteristics
```

### :keyboard: Activity: Create a case study analysis branch

1. Open a new browser tab and navigate to your new repository. Then work on the steps in your second tab while you read the instructions in this tab.
2. Navigate to the **Code** tab in the header menu of your repository.
3. Click on the **main** branch dropdown.
4. In the field, name your branch `medical-history-analysis`. Branches should be descriptively named.
5. Click **Create branch: medical-history-analysis** to create your branch.
6. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page. The training will automatically advance to Step 2.
