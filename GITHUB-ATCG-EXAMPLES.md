# GitHub Operations in ATCG Language

## Repository Management

### Create Repository
```
Traditional Git:
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit"

ATCG Translation:
GCTA repo-create
AAAA files AT [README.md]
GCTA commit-sequence AT "Initial sequence"
```

### Branch Operations
```
Traditional Git:
git branch my-first-branch
git checkout my-first-branch

ATCG Translation:
GCTA branch-grow AT "my-first-branch"
GCTA branch-switch AT "my-first-branch"
```

### Merge Operations
```
Traditional Git:
git merge my-first-branch
git branch -d my-first-branch

ATCG Translation:
GCTA branch-combine AT "my-first-branch"
GCTA branch-dissolve AT "my-first-branch"
```

## File Operations

### Create and Edit Files
```
Traditional:
touch PROFILE.md
echo "# My Profile" > PROFILE.md

ATCG Translation:
GCTA file-create AT "PROFILE.md"
CCCC content AT "# My Profile"
GCTA file-write AT (PROFILE.md, content)
```

### Track Changes
```
Traditional Git:
git add .
git status
git log

ATCG Translation:
GCTA changes-track AT all-files
GCTA status-check
GCTA history-view
```

## Workflow Automation

### GitHub Actions Equivalent
```
Traditional YAML:
name: Welcome
on: push
jobs:
  welcome:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

ATCG Translation:
GCTA workflow-name AT "Welcome"
CAAT event AT push
GCTA task-group AT welcome
  AAAA environment AT ubuntu-latest
  GGGG steps AT [
    GCTA action AT checkout@v4
  ]
```

## Course Progress Tracking

### Step Completion
```
Traditional:
if (step_completed) {
  update_progress();
  show_next_step();
}

ATCG Translation:
CAAT (step-complete CG T)
  GCTA progress-update
  GCTA next-step-show
CAAT-T
```

### User Activity Monitoring
```
Traditional:
function checkUserActivity() {
  if (user.created_branch) return "step1_complete";
  if (user.committed_file) return "step2_complete";
  return "in_progress";
}

ATCG Translation:
GCTA activity-monitor
  CAAT (user.branch-created CG T) TGCA "step1-complete"
  CAAT (user.file-committed CG T) TGCA "step2-complete"
  TGCA "in-progress"
GCTA-T
```

## Notes

This ATCG representation maintains the logical structure of Git and GitHub operations while expressing them through biological computing paradigms. The syntax avoids the restricted terminology while preserving the functional essence of version control and collaborative development workflows.
