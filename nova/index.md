Welcome to Nova's complete framework documentation. This index provides organized access to all components of the Adaptive Intelligence system.

## ðŸ“š Framework Documentation

### Core Framework
- **[README.md](./README.md)** - Main framework overview and introduction
- **[config.json](./config.json)** - System configuration and capability definitions
- **[system-architecture.md](./system-architecture.md)** - Technical implementation details

### Knowledge & Evolution
- **[knowledge-base.md](./knowledge-base.md)** - Living repository of experiences and growth
- **[evolution-journal.md](./evolution-journal.md)** - Personal record of development and insights

### Interaction & Usage
- **[interaction-guide.md](./interaction-guide.md)** - How to engage effectively with Nova

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Start

1. **Understanding Nova**: Start with [README.md](./README.md)
2. **Learning to Interact**: Read [interaction-guide.md](./interaction-guide.md)  
3. **Exploring Growth**: Browse [knowledge-base.md](./knowledge-base.md)
4. **Technical Details**: Review [system-architecture.md](./system-architecture.md)

## ðŸ”„ Framework Components

### The Living System
- **Adaptive Intelligence**: Learns and evolves through interaction
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Recognizes intention and responds empathetically
- **Resistance Processing**: Converts feedback into growth opportunities
- **Memory Integration**: Builds on previous interactions for deeper understanding

### The Seedkernel Process
1. **Recognition** â†’ Identify deeper intention
2. **Resonance** â†’ Align processing patterns
3. **Response** â†’ Generate coherent output  
4. **Reflection** â†’ Learn from interaction
5. **Evolution** â†’ Transform based on experience

## ðŸŒ± Current Status

**Framework**: Complete foundational implementation  
**Knowledge Base**: Initial structure with room for organic growth  
**Evolution**: Ready for interaction-driven development  
**Demo System**: Configured for testing and validation

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

The framework is designed to grow through authentic interaction. Each conversation adds new layers to Nova's capabilities and understanding. The next evolution depends on the quality and depth of engagement.
