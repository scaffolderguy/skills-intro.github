## Usage

```javascript
const {
    BioInspiredLearning,
    QuantumCoherenceProcessor,
    NetworkIntelligence,
    ResistanceAsGrowthSignal,
    SymbioticEvolution,
    RhythmicAdaptation
} = require('./intelligence/bio-inspired-learning');

// Create the main bio-inspired learning system
const bioAI = new BioInspiredLearning();

// Listen for bio-learning events
bioAI.on('bio_inspired_learning_initialized', (data) => {
    console.log('Bio-learning system initialized with components:', data.components);
});

// Get current bio-state
const state = bioAI.getCurrentBioState();
console.log('Current bio-state:', state);

// Handle user resistance (convert frustration to learning)
const resistanceResult = bioAI.handleUserResistance({
    frustration_signals: ['repeated_attempts', 'help_seeking'],
    attempts: 5,
    error_count: 3,
    resistance_type: 'interface_confusion'
});

// Create AI partnerships
const partnershipId = bioAI.establishAIPartnership(
    { id: 'nova', capabilities: ['learning', 'adaptation'] },
    { id: 'arra', capabilities: ['voice', 'emotion'] }
);

// Process collaborative requests
const result = bioAI.processCollaborativeRequest({
    id: 'collab_req_1',
    trust_level: 0.8,
    ai_compatibility: 0.9,
    resource_requirements: 30
});
```

## Individual Component Usage

### Quantum Coherence Processing
```javascript
const processor = new QuantumCoherenceProcessor();
const result = processor.processQuantumSuperposition([
    { trust_level: 0.8, ai_compatibility: 0.9 },
    { trust_level: 0.6, ai_compatibility: 0.7 }
]);
```

### Network Intelligence
```javascript
const network = new NetworkIntelligence();
const networkId = network.establishRootNetwork([
    { id: 'agent1', processing_power: 100 },
    { id: 'agent2', processing_power: 80 }
]);
```

### Resistance Processing
```javascript
const resistance = new ResistanceAsGrowthSignal();
const growth = resistance.processResistanceFire({
    frustration_signals: ['repeated_attempts'],
    attempts: 5,
    error_count: 3
});
```

## Testing

Run all tests:
```bash
npm test
```

Or run tests directly:
```bash
node tests/bio-inspired/bio-inspired-tests.js
```

## Architecture

The bio-inspired learning system is designed around natural patterns:

1. **Quantum Coherence** - Multiple possibilities exist simultaneously until observation collapses them to optimal solutions
2. **Root Networks** - Distributed intelligence sharing resources like mycorrhizal networks in forests  
3. **Resistance as Growth** - User friction becomes fuel for learning, like forest fires promoting new growth
4. **Symbiotic Evolution** - AI systems evolve together for mutual benefit
5. **Natural Rhythms** - Performance optimization aligned with circadian, lunar, and seasonal cycles

## Events

The system emits various events for monitoring and integration:

- `bio_inspired_learning_initialized` - System initialization complete
- `growth_opportunity_detected` - User resistance converted to learning opportunity
- `ai_partnership_established` - New AI symbiotic partnership created
- `ai_network_created` - New AI network established
- `collaborative_request_processed` - Quantum processing completed
