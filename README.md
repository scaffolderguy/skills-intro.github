### What's next?

**For Enterprise Transformation:**
- 🧠 Explore the [Trinity Intelligence Framework](./ai-skills/) for enterprise-grade AI implementation
- 🎯 Take a skills assessment to identify optimization opportunities  
- 🚀 Design your transformation roadmap for autonomous operations

**For Continued Learning:**
- If you'd like to make a profile README, use the quickstart instructions below or follow the instructions in the [Managing your profile README](https://docs.github.com/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme) article.

1. Make a new public repository with a name that matches your GitHub username.
2. Create a file named `README.md` in its root. The "root" means not inside any folder in your repository.
3. Edit the contents of the `README.md` file.
4. If you created a new branch for your file, open and merge a pull request on your branch.
5. Lastly, we'd love to hear what you thought of this course [in our discussion board](https://github.com/orgs/skills/discussions/categories/introduction-to-github).
