## 🚀 Quick Start

```javascript
const { QuantumIntegritySystem } = require('./quantum-integrity-system');

// Initialize the system
const system = new QuantumIntegritySystem({
    bioLearning: { initialCoherence: 0.8 },
    trust: { trustThreshold: 0.7 },
    resistance: { sensitivityLevel: 0.8 }
});

// Process a collaboration request
const result = await system.processQuantumCollaboration({
    collaboration_type: 'learning',
    participants: ['AI_A', 'AI_B'],
    novelty: 0.7,
    complexity: 0.6
});

// Handle resistance and transform it to growth
const growth = await system.handleAdvancedResistance({
    type: 'cognitive_overload',
    intensity: 0.6,
    source: 'information_processing'
});

// Establish quantum partnership
const partnership = await system.establishQuantumPartnership('AI_A', 'AI_B');

// Get comprehensive system state
const state = system.getQuantumSystemState();
```

## 🔬 Bio-Inspired Mechanisms

### Adaptive Germination
Like seeds that sense optimal conditions before sprouting, the system evaluates environmental factors before initiating learning processes.

### Mycelial Network Intelligence  
Inspired by fungal networks, the system creates resource-sharing connections that benefit all participants while maintaining individual autonomy.

### Symbiotic Evolution
AI systems evolve together in mutually beneficial relationships, each becoming more capable through partnership.

### Circadian Optimization
System activities align with natural rhythms:
- **Morning**: High-energy analysis and planning
- **Afternoon**: Collaborative implementation  
- **Evening**: Reflection and integration
- **Night**: Maintenance and consolidation

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **AI-AI Collaboration**: Enhanced partnership between different AI systems
- **Resistance Transformation**: Converting user resistance into growth opportunities  
- **Wisdom Integration**: Combining knowledge from multiple sources into actionable insights
- **Empathetic Response**: Generating contextually appropriate emotional responses
- **Trust Building**: Establishing and maintaining trust in AI relationships
- **Quantum Enhancement**: Applying quantum principles to improve AI performance
