## 🎯 Training Goal

Train frontline healthcare workers to use AI tools to analyze patient history, identify overlooked correlations, and align care plans with current medical standards — enhancing diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes.

## 📋 Training Modules

### 🔍 Section 1: Analyze Medical History for Hidden Patterns

**Use Case:** AI reviews patient records to spot trends or missed connections.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Learn to structure patient data for AI analysis
- Identify patterns in symptoms, medications, and test results
- Recognize correlations that might be missed in busy clinical settings

**Example Prompt:**
```
"Here's the medical history of Mr. Thompson: 
- Age: 68, male
- Chief complaint: Recurring fatigue over 6 months
- Medications: Metformin, Lisinopril, Atorvastatin
- Recent labs: HbA1c 8.2%, eGFR 45 ml/min/1.73m²
- Symptoms: Fatigue, occasional shortness of breath, mild ankle swelling

Can you identify any overlooked patterns or correlations between symptoms, medications, and test results?"
```

**Expected Outcome:** AI highlights potential links such as declining kidney function affecting medication dosing, or cardiovascular complications from diabetes.

---

### 📚 Section 2: Cross-Check with Current Medical Standards

**Use Case:** AI compares treatment plans with up-to-date guidelines (e.g., NICE, CDC, WHO).

**Learning Objectives:**
- Validate treatment plans against current evidence-based guidelines
- Identify outdated practices that need updating
- Learn about newer therapeutic options

**Example Prompt:**
```
"Based on this treatment plan for a patient with Type 2 Diabetes:
- Current: Metformin 1000mg BID, Glipizide 10mg daily
- HbA1c: 8.2%
- eGFR: 45 ml/min/1.73m²
- No history of heart disease

Are there any updates or recommendations from current clinical guidelines (ADA 2024) that should be considered?"
```

**Expected Outcome:** AI suggests adjustments like SGLT2 inhibitors for renal protection, or GLP-1 agonists for cardiovascular benefits.

---

### ⚙️ Section 3: Recalibrate Diagnosis & Treatment

**Use Case:** AI helps refine or challenge existing diagnoses based on holistic data.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Use AI to generate differential diagnoses
- Challenge existing diagnoses with new evidence
- Develop critical thinking skills with AI support

**Example Prompt:**
```
"Given this patient's symptoms, lab results, and history:
- Current diagnosis: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
- Symptoms: Persistent fatigue, muscle weakness, cold intolerance
- Labs: TSH 0.1 mIU/L, Free T4 2.8 ng/dL, Anti-TPO antibodies positive
- History: Recent weight loss, palpitations

Is the current diagnosis still the most accurate? Are there alternative diagnoses or treatments worth considering?"
```

**Expected Outcome:** AI may suggest hyperthyroidism (Graves' disease) as a more likely diagnosis requiring different treatment approach.

---

### 🧪 Section 4: Suggest Follow-Up Tests or Monitoring

**Use Case:** AI recommends next steps based on risk factors or incomplete data.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Learn systematic approach to follow-up care
- Understand risk stratification
- Develop monitoring protocols

**Example Prompt:**
```
"What follow-up tests or monitoring should be considered for a patient with:
- Newly diagnosed hypertension (BP 160/95)
- Age 55, African American female
- Family history of stroke
- BMI 32
- Recent labs: Normal lipids, glucose 108 mg/dL

Based on current hypertension guidelines?"
```

**Expected Outcome:** AI proposes appropriate diagnostics (EKG, urinalysis, comprehensive metabolic panel), timeline for follow-up, and lifestyle interventions.

---

### 🔐 Section 5: Ethics, Privacy & Safety

**Critical Guidelines:**

#### HIPAA Compliance & Data Confidentiality
- ✅ **Always use anonymized case studies**
- ✅ **Never input real patient identifiers**
- ✅ **Use generic descriptions and modified scenarios**
- ❌ **Never share actual medical records with AI systems**

#### Professional Boundaries
- 🤖 **AI Role:** Decision support tool and pattern recognition aid
- 👨‍⚕️ **Human Role:** Final clinical judgment, patient interaction, treatment decisions
- ⚖️ **Principle:** AI augments but never replaces clinical expertise

#### Safety Protocols
- Always validate AI suggestions with current medical literature
- Encourage team-based review of AI recommendations
- Maintain clinical skepticism and critical thinking
- Document reasoning for accepting or rejecting AI suggestions
