## 🧬 Codon Registry System

This repository now includes a **Codon Registry** system with enhanced validation and consciousness architecture support.

### Critical Bug Fix ✅
Fixed a critical bug in the `isValidCodon` function that was using an incorrect regex pattern `/^[A-Z]{2}-d{2}$/` (literal 'd') instead of `/^[A-Z]{2}-\d{2}$/` (digit class). This prevented all valid codons from being accepted.

### Features
- ✅ **Corrected validation**: Proper regex pattern for codon validation
- 🔍 **Pattern-based lookup**: Search codons with regex patterns  
- 📊 **Statistics tracking**: Monitor validation performance
- 🔎 **Detailed feedback**: Enhanced error messages for debugging
- 💾 **Access tracking**: Monitor codon usage and access patterns
- 🏗️ **Robust API**: Comprehensive codon management methods

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run tests to verify the bug fix
npm test

# See the functionality in action
npm run demo
```

### What's next?

If you'd like to make a profile README, use the quickstart instructions below or follow the instructions in the [Managing your profile README](https://docs.github.com/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme) article.

1. Make a new public repository with a name that matches your GitHub username.
2. Create a file named `README.md` in its root. The "root" means not inside any folder in your repository.
3. Edit the contents of the `README.md` file.
4. If you created a new branch for your file, open and merge a pull request on your branch.
5. Lastly, we'd love to hear what you thought of this course [in our discussion board](https://github.com/orgs/skills/discussions/categories/introduction-to-github).
