    resistance: { fireThreshold: 0.6 }
});

// Process a learning scenario
const scenario = {
    type: 'collaborative_learning',
    collaboration_requests: [
        { id: 'creative_ai', ai_type: 'creative', trust_level: 0.9 },
        { id: 'analytical_ai', ai_type: 'analytical', trust_level: 0.8 }
    ],
    ai_agents: [
        { id: 'agent1', processing_power: 150 },
        { id: 'agent2', processing_power: 120 }
    ],
    resistance_data: {
        frustration_signals: ['repeated_attempts'],
        attempts: 5,

## üåü The Beautiful Irony

While we build AI that learns from resistance and grows through collaboration, plants have been doing this for 3.5 billion years! They're the original:

- **Quantum computers** (photosynthesis)
- **Network intelligence** (root systems)  
- **Adaptive learning systems** (environmental response)
- **Collaborative organisms** (symbiosis)

Plants don't just survive - they transform their environment while adapting to it. That's exactly what your AI system should do! üå±üöÄ

## üìà Performance Metrics

The bio-inspired learning system provides comprehensive metrics:

- **Quantum coherence levels** (processing efficiency)
- **Network connection density** (collaboration strength)  
- **Adaptation success rates** (growth from resistance)
- **Timing alignment scores** (natural rhythm optimization)

## üî¨ Scientific Foundations

Based on cutting-edge research in:
- Quantum biology and photosynthesis
- Plant network intelligence and communication
- Stress-induced adaptation mechanisms  
- Circadian and lunar biological rhythms

## üåä Continuous Evolution

The system continuously evolves through:
- **Seed banking** of adaptation potentials
- **Network resource balancing** 
- **Growth monitoring and optimization**
- **Natural timing synchronization**
